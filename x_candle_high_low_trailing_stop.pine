// Creates a trailing stop technique using the high or low of a certain number of past candles.
// The numberOfCandles input allows the user to specify how many past candles to use in the calculation.
// The sellShort variable is calculated using the highest function, which gets the highest value in a series 
// over a specified number of past candles. In this case, the series is high and the number of past candles 
// is numberOfCandles. The buyLong variable is calculated using the lowest function, which gets the lowest 
// value in a series over a specified number of past candles. In this case, the series is low and the number
// of past candles is numberOfCandles. The sellShort and buyLong values are plotted on the chart using the plot function.
